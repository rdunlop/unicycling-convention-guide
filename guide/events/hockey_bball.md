Hockey/Basketball

* When will the teams be set?

* Competitors want to know which days that they will be playing so that they can schedule going to other events/places.

    * When will the schedule with teams be set?

    * How will this be communicated with the competitors?

* Playing on a concrete floor is not a good idea, as it has led to a number of broken bones at UNICON because it is so hard

* It is the responsibility of the Director to ensure that all members of each team are properly entered into the system

    * We need to know who is playing on each team in order to:

        * properly award the correct people

        * Prevent non-competitors from playing on teams

        * Prevent competitors from playing on multiple teams

* Ensure that the roster of each team is fully and accurately entered into the system.

    * This should occurs before the end of competition, preferably before ech team plays a game, so as to verify the membership.
