Event checklist:

For every event:

* Where are the bathrooms

    * Are there enough? (For races, everyone wants to go before they race)

    * Is there enough toilet paper? Where is more?

* Where are the garbage cans?

    * Are the garbages large enough? Do you need extra bags?

* What are your rain plans?

    * Do your volunteers have umbrellas/ponchos?

    * Will your sign-in papers get wet/broken?

    * What is your backup time/location? (so that you can announce it, if you need to go there)

* When will awards be given out?

    * This should be on the printed schedule, including location of awards

    * For events with a lot of data, we recommend 24 hours for protests/issues.

    * For events with battles/etc, you can do the awards immediately, and enter the results officially after the event

* There should be an envelope for all judging results

    * Use this envelope to hold all results written by judges/officials

    * Once the data is entered into the official record, this data may become the property of the convention-results-official.
