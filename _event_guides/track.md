# Track Racing

## Track/Venue Quality/Questions

* Where is the track racing?
* Do we have access to the press box?
* Do we have access to the sound system?
* Where is there access to power outlets for laptops/printer?
  * The power should be accessible at the time the volunteers arrive, not ONLY at the time the competition begins
* Where is the bathroom?
  * The bathroom should be accessible at the time the volunteers arrive, not ONLY at the time the competition begins

## Equipment

* Do you have tents to set up to shade the organizers?
* Are we allowed to set up on the infield?
* Do you have tables/chairs for the volunteers
  * Registration/Sign-in
  * Results/printing
* Metric-measuring device (centimeters, not inches)
  * For use in measuring the 10m, 30m, and 50m lines
* Do you have hip-numbers?
  * If you do not have enough, contact the timing group, and have them supply them (for a fee, of course)
